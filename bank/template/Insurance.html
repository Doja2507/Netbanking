                    Life Insurance can be defined as a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurance
                    company,
                    where the insurer promises to pay a sum of money in exchange for a premium, upon the death of an
                    insured
                    person or after a set period. Here, at OUR bank, you pay premiums for a specific term and in return,
                    we
                    provide you with a Life Cover. This Life Cover secures your loved ones’ future by paying a lump sum
                    amount in case of an unfortunate event. In some policies, you are paid an amount called Maturity
                    Benefit
                    at the end of the policy term.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two basic types of Life Insurance plans -
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pure Protection</li>
                    <li>Protection and Savings</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>What is Pure Protection Plan?</h3>
                <p>
                    A Pure Protection plan is designed to secure your family’s future by providing a lump sum amount, in
                    your absence.
                </p>
                <h3>What is Protection and Savings Plan?</h3>
                <p>
                    A Protection and Savings plan is a financial tool that helps you plan for your long-term goals like
                    purchasing a home, funding your children’s education, and more, while offering the benefits of a
                    Life
                    Cover.

                <h3>Factors that affect life insurance premium</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that you know what is life insurance and why you need it, find out the factors that can affect
                    the
                    life insurance premium:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age: One of the prime factors that affect the premium for a life insurance plan is your age. The
                        life insurance premium is lower for younger people and gradually increases with age</li>
                    <li>Gender: Studies have shown women live longer than men1. Therefore, the life insurance premium is
                        lower for women as compared to men</li>
                    <li>Health conditions: Your present and past health conditions can determine the premium for your
                        life
                        insurance plan. If you have any pre-existing illnesses or have suffered from an illness in the
                        past
                        that may resurface or affect your present health, you would be charged a higher premium</li>
                    <li>Family health history: The chances of suffering from a disease that runs in your family are
                        considerably high. So, if any hereditary illnesses run in your family, you may have to pay a
                        higher
                        premium</li>
                    <li>Smoking and drinking alcohol: Lifestyle habits like smoking and drinking alcohol can impact your
                        health and lead to multiple health issues. Therefore, insurance companies charge a high premium
                        for
                        individuals who smoke or drink alcohol</li>
                    <li>Type of coverage: The type of coverage you opt for can increase or decrease the life insurance
                        plan’s premium.</li>
                    <li>Amount of coverage: A higher sum assured would result in a higher premium and vice versa</li>
                    <li>Occupation: If you work in a high-risk job, the premium for your life insurance plan would be
                        higher
                        than others.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Let us understand how Life Insurance works:</h3>
                <p>
                    In today's era, having a life insurance policy is a must for every individual as it is one of the
                    best
                    ways to secure one's future along with their loved ones. There are many different types of life
                    insurance policies available in the market. However, before choosing one, it is important to
                    understand
                    how a life insurance policy works. Let us look at an example to understand how life insurance works:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, let’s see an example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Kumar (Life Assured) pays OUR bank an annual amount (Premium) over 5 years (Premium Payment
                    Term) to
                    make sure that his wife (Nominee) gets a certain assured sum of money (Life Cover) in case of an
                    unfortunate event during the 10 years or Lumpsum amount at maturity on survival at the end of policy
                    term.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life insurance not only covers the risk arising due to an unfortunate event but also gives you
                    additional benefits like tax benefits, savings, and wealth creation over a period of time. The right
                    life insurance plan from a trusted company can help one get long-term risk cover plus savings, i.e.,
                    dual benefits from one solution.
